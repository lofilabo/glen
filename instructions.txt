OVERVIEW AND DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS

Contained in this archive /repository are all of the files needed to run the
M3 Test application as described as follows:

"Create a ‘TO DO’ web application that will provide the following functionality"

The application uses the BALSA framework, which is a tiny (toy) PHP web
application framework for demonstration purposes.  The framework is structured
as follows:

index.php (entry point)

Y_CONFIG - all configuration files
  config.php - the file in which the database configuration is set.
Y_GLOBALS - system files used throughout the application
  loginchecker.php - the file which contains the (very crude!) login /
  validation routine.
Y_IO - utilities for file IO

Z_CONTROL - Controllers
Z_VIEW - Template HTML files
Z_ZLOGIC - Database access files

Z-UNIVERSAL
  app_view.em - the main HTML file for the whole application.
  (the user may edit this to provide a look and feel for the whole
  application)

SOME LIMITATIONS.
The application has been constructed with an all-my-own-work implementation of
the MVC design pattern and not a proven framework.  It naturally has some
very basic features which would not not be acceptable in a commercial
application:
- No database abstraction
    Database queries are accomplished using passthrough SQL queries
    with the attendant security risks
- No routing engine
    'REST'-type routes are not available.  URI's are formed of The
    standard URL?key1=value1&key2=value2... vartypes
- No template engine
    PHP tags are available within the .em template file, as are [-- --]
    tokens which provide for very limited PHP functionality.

The implementation as-id serves to demonstrate the value of the MVC concept:
separate files are used for:
  database interrogation
  programmatic Logic
  display

As its (very severe!) limitations become apparent, it will also serve as
a point of advocacy for the use of a Better / More-Mature framework.

Where useful, OO principles are used.  For instance, each 'controller' class
only ever calls the same method in order to render.  Where possible, the CoC.
(Convention Over Configuration) model is used: to invoke a part of the operation
called 'sayhello', the uri
  [domain]?op=sayhello
is used.  It is then expected that the application will find a sayhello.PHP
file in the Z_CONTROL directory (for programmatic logic), a sayhello.php
file in the Z_LOGIC directory (for database access) and a sayhell.em file
in the Z_VIEW directory.

DEPLOYMENT.

Unpack the archive to a directory on your machine; in the root of this
directory, run the built-in PHP Web Server:

  php -S 127.0.0.1:8081

  (the application may, of course, be run under your favourite http
  server; the configuration should be trivial.  The PHP Testing server
  is used here so as to minimise dependencies, and to allow a means of
  demonstrating the Console Debugger, which is extremely useful when
  developing AJAX applications which do not produce sensible HTTP output
  on failure.)

Point your browser at this URL.  You should see some test data appear in
the browser and some debug output in your terminal window.

Next, execute the SQL file in the root of the application to build the
MySQL database.  Edit the file Y_CONFIG to reflect the settings of your
database server.  Test this with the URL:

  127.0.0.1:8081/index.php?op=test

You will be challenged for a username/password (as agreed).
After enetering the usraname and password, you should now see this
test data (pulled from the database):
array(3) {
[0]=>
array(2) {
["id"]=>
string(1) "1"
["data"]=>
string(3) "One"
}
(...)

These are the evidence that the database is set up correctly and the
connection is being made. (NOTE: Passwords are NOT stored in any encrypted
way within the database.  In a production system, this would of course NOT
be the case!)

Note that, once the debug-demonstration and connection-demonstration routines
have been run, it is possible to delete them from the application.  It is
neither harmful nor helpful to do so for the purposes of this demonstration.

If you wish, you may force the entry point to the application to be the 'list'
operation by modifying index.php such that

LINE 65
$pg=new basic_c;

is changed to

$pg=new list_c; //this will change the class that the application loads
                //by default.

(it also possible to immediately show the 'new item', form by setting
$pg = new add_c)

The Application
The basic entry point for the application is:

127.0.0.1:8081/index.php?op=list

This will show a list of all the TDD (To-Do Documents) currently stored.
The columns:
  items
  date added
  date date
  priority

are available for sorting in ascending (UP) and descending(DOWN) order.

The basic logic of this is contained in the file Z_CONTROL/list.php

The function used for database access is in the file Z_LOGIC/list.php

The HTML to render the list is in the file Z_VIEW/list.em


DELETE A ROW ITEM.

Click the link on the far RHS of any given item to delete it.  This will take
the following action:

1. Use very basic JavaScript to pop up a Confirm box.  If the conditions of
the Confirm are agreed to, the URL path:

127.0.0.1/index.php?op=delete&id=3

will be called where in this case, id=3 refers to the record ID which will be
deleted.


INSERT A NEW ROW ITEM.

Click on the link in the application menu.
This will run add_c inside the class file Z_CONTROL/add.php

LOGIN HISTORY

User Login History is stored in a flat (tab-delimited) file to demonstrate
a method of data storage when an RDBMS is not strictly necessary and the
data is easily human-readable.

BULK Delete

Functionality for this operation is also found in the Z_CONTROL/del.php
class file.  It is invoked if the URI key ids (and not id) contains a
comma-separated string of numeric chars.

KNOWN ISSUES AND IMPROVEMENTS:

A good deal of thought has been put into the OO design of the applications
(can you spot the Abstract Factory implementation and the use of pass-through
inheritance?  If not....good!) but certain commonalities to similar files
could easily be further abstracted out (for instance, each data class contains
its own executeSQL method, which there is probably a way of abstracting, except
that each of these methods are subtly different.)

Because the purpose of this project is to demonstrate a concept, and NOT
particularly concerned with security, there are large vulnerabilities
to SQL injection, and the login operation can be fairly easily defeated
by brute force.  In production, a 3rd party login/validation system would almost
certainly be used (either an oAuth library or a framework-included security
model).  This is almost a justification for the use of a PHP framework with no
other considerations.

jQuery is not used.  This choice was made because in this example, it is not 
necessary.  This imposes some limitations on user interface capability -
it might, for instance, make for a more rewarding UX if a
